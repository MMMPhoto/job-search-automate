## Description

Job Search Automate is a Python application that uses regex methods to sort and categorize LinkedIn API data based on keywords, automating a process that otherwise would take significant time and effort. The App uses the unofficial [LinkedIn API](https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api) created by [Tom Quirk](https://github.com/tomquirk) and adds some extra keyword search functionality to filter and categorize results.

Currently the app uses hardcoded variables as search inputs and 
The Social Network API program is a Node.js server-side application that runs a Mongo NoSQL database containing data for a social media platform. The program uses the Mongoose package for object modeling and communicating with the database, and the Express package for routing. Since the program is entirely back-end, it's helpful to use an API tool such as Postman to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls to view and manipulate the database.
