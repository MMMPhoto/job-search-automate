The FUNetix 12 hours Reading App is available in the App Store, Google Play store and Amazon App store.\nFUNetix is 19-years-new, but in some ways, it is more than 2,000 years old.\nIndeed, the patented FUNetix Reading Decoding System is rooted in an ancient methodology that shows readers how to see the hidden sounds in every word.\nFUNetix earned its patent by borrowing the time-tested method called \"diacritics\" (which was developed more than 2,000 years ago by the Greeks, and adopted more than 1,000 years ago by the Hebrew and Arabic languages, to teach ALL children how to read those languages), and uniquely, completely and systematically applying it to English in a child-friendly and simple way.\nFUNetix teaches children how to \"map\" or \"marry\" all 44 sounds of the English language to the letters and letter combinations that make up English words. This mapping (made easy by diacritics) takes all of the guesswork out of \"sounding out\" words.\nHave you ever wanted to do something AMAZING to change the world but didn't know where to start?\nHere is an opportunity to join the American Youth Literacy Foundation, an all- volunteer 501 c 3 charitable non-profit organization, founded in 2008 and dedicated to providing a gateway to a future in which all children, in every classroom in America, learn how to read by the end of 3rd grade. Our mission is to save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy and bring about true education parity in just a few years\u2019 time by deploying the FUNetix(r) 12 Hour Reading App(tm) nationwide.\nWith the FUNetix app, which is 100% free to download and use, any child can learn how to read in about 12 hours of total play time; and in America\u2019s public schools today, there are millions of children who can\u2019t read or are struggling to read, which has led to more than 20 million illiterate high school dropouts over the past 20 years. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way!\nWe started in 2008 by taking a groundbreaking, science-based curriculum and proving that it can scale to reach and help thousands of children. Then, in 2020, during the pandemic, we created an app, based on our now patented reading curriculum, that takes kids from the ABC's to a 2nd grade reading level through an amazing journey that's fully narrated and tastefully animated, and gamified, just enough, to create an immersive, interactive environment that captures kids' attention and imagination and launches them to literacy in a fun and easy way.\nOur challenge now is to bring the app to millions of children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons.\nRight now, we are looking to expand our incredible Team FUNetix and we are looking for a skilled Volunteer as a Full Stack Developer / Consultant for Children\u2019s Literacy App.\nThe Full Stack Developer Consultant will be responsible for managing and maintaining our Apple and Android developer status, liaising with our external engineering partners, and, as needed, modifying our frontend and backend software for the FUNetix 12 Hour Reading App. The Full Stack Developer will also be working on the development of a new app the FUNetix ESL app, which is projected to launch in 2025.\nWe hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.\nSo, if this sounds like something that you have the time for and interest in, and if you have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms, then please reply to this listing and tell us about yourself.\nWe look forward to hearing from you and speaking with you about the future of literacy in America.\nYou can read more about our story, and about our team, on our website at www.FUNetix.org.\nMr. R.
